## Ethnicity representation across cinematic borders
Exploring ethnic representation in movies over the years in our selected regions tells us a lot about how cinema reflects and changes with society. We gain insights into the complex interaction of culture, identity, and film in these regions. Our goal is to identify regions that present a richer variety of ethnicities on screen.

### Ethnicity melting pot  
The first step of our analysis is to examine our actor dataset globally, considering their ethnicities across various regions. This first observation is crucial to have a better understanding of what follows.
This word cloud visually represents the ethnicities in each region, where the size of each ethnicity's name s proportional to its frequency of occurence in the data.

Ethnicities linked to actors in this CMU movie dataset are highly specific, making it challenging to form broader subgroups that ethically group different ethnicities together. This can generate  challenge for the further exploration of ethicity representation:  

- Presence of two many precise categories ungroupable
- Occurence of many ethnicithies with a very small frequencies which are part of the dataset and we have to use them to avoid biases and misrepresentation in the results  

Film industries in our four region of the world are large melting pot of actors coming from different horizon. To gain a better visualization of the ethnic composition within this complex melting pot, we can examine the proportion of each ethnicity across different geographical areas.


### Ethnic diversity over years  
In order to go further in our exploration we are going to compare how this ethnicity diversity evolves across years in our four group when taking into account the amout of produced movies. The large proportion of missing values, which is unevenly distributed among the groups, makes these plots less reliable.

Examining our dataset film production trends across our four regions is crucial for parallel analysis alongside the evolution of ethnicity representation. Eastern asian films remains consistently low and quite constant over the years. This will make the ethnicity diversity proportional analysis more complicated for this region. On the other hand, the other three regions have experienced an increase in film production since the 1980s, providing more opportunities for diverse ethnic representation. The growth in the movie industry is noticeable at different scales in Northern America, Europe, and Asia. However, last few years are associated with a drastic reduced amount of film available in our data set making comparisons difficult since 2010.

title: Actors' connections
---

Exploring the connections between actors in the network tells us a lot about the importance of each of them. The goal of this part is to explore the relations between actors to find out who is the most important actor in the network and what general conclusions can be drawn from the characteristics of the most influential actors.

The first thing we can do is to find out who is the most connected actor in the network. We can do this by calculating the degree of each actor and then sorting them in descending order. The degree of an actor is the number of connections it has with other actors. The higher the degree, the more connected the actor is.

As we can see in those distribution plots, the vast majority of actors have a very low degree. This means that most actors are not connected to many other actors. However, there are a few actors that are very well connected. In fact, the most connected actor in the Northern America has a degree of 1382 while the median degree is 28. This shows well the disparity between the most connected actors and the rest of the network.

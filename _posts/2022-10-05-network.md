title: Exploring the interconnected world of actors
---

The intricate web of connections between actors in the cinema industry is not just a curiosity, it's a reflection of influence, opportunity, and the dynamics of the industry. Our exploration aims to uncover the pivotal figures in this network and draw insights from the traits of these influential players.

## Navigating the seas of stardom

### Identifying the network hubs

Our first step is to identify the most connected actors in the network. This is done by calculating the degree of each actor (the number of direct connections they have). Actors with higher degrees are central nodes in this vast network, people that we can call big whales in the ocean of the cinema industry.

The disparity in connection degrees is striking. Most actors have few links, with a median degree of just 28. In contrast, some are extraordinarily well-connected, like a North American actor boasting 1382 connections. This stark contrast highlights the uneven distribution of influence and reach.

### The power of connection for new actors

For an emerging actor, these "big whales" are vital. They are the gatekeepers to broader networks and greater influence. However, accessing these well-connected individuals is a significant challenge. We've pinpointed the top 2% of the most connected, active actors to help newcomers navigate these waters.

Among these influential figures, here are a few notable names:

## Unveiling patterns among the stars

Moving beyond just identifying the most connected actors, our focus shifts to understanding the characteristics that define these influential figures. We start by spotlighting the most powerful women in the industry.

Do these top-tier actors share similar backgrounds, career paths, or even genres they frequently appear in? Are there discernible patterns in their rise to prominence? This part of our study delves into these questions, seeking to unravel the threads that weave these successful careers together.

## Are the most famous actors identical ?

Now that we know who are the most connected actors, we can try to find out what are the characteristics of those actors. First, as Jol√©a is a woman, we will concentrate on the most powerfull woman in the industry. We then want to find similarities between the most connected actresses.

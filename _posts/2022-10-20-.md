## Reading between the lines of plot summaries

Movie summaries contain a lot of hidden information about female representation of the film industries and should be examined with the same passion and attention as a Shakespeare manuscript.

The textual data primarily encodes insights into how personna and common themes are portrayed across various movies. Uncovering such details from raw texts involves a nuanced approach, requiring a careful examination between the lines, coupled with the application of machine learning techniques. All plot summaries have undergone meticulous processing using the [Stanford Core NLP pipeline](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/pipeline.html), and the outcomes of this processing are neatly presented in the accompanying dataset. Our current objective is to delve into this dataset to unearth the inherent narratives within each plot summary.

This supplementary dataset encompasses a wealth of features related to the text, including:

- In-depth analysis of each word in the text, revealing details such as its lemma (root word) or its part of speech (noun, adjective, etc.).
- Identification of dependencies between words within the same sentence.
- Recognition of co-references related to the same entity throughout the text.

Various techniques, such as extracting words linked to a common theme, assessing the sentiment embedded in sentences containing those words, and scrutinizing words frequently associated with theme-related terms, serve as diverse approaches to deciphering the subtleties within these movie plot summaries. Let's delve into what these features unveil about the movies.

#### What are the most recurrent female-related words?

A comprehensive analysis of the vocabulary used in each summary was conducted to identify the most recurrent words related to females. The visual representation highlights variations in the frequency of appearance across regions.

While the pronoun "she" consistently appears first in each region, other words differ slightly based on cinematic industries. Notably, in the Northern American vocabulary, women are often depicted in relational roles, with dominant words such as "sister," "wife," "mother," "daughter," and even "girlfriend."

#### How are women depicted in the plot summaries?

NLP analysis of plot summaries enables the extraction of correferences, referring to words associated with female-related terms within the summaries. Examining these correferences provides valuable insights into how women are portrayed across diverse cinematic industries. By scrutinizing the representation of women on screen, we can discern the most fitting roles for our esteemed actress, Joléa.

The accompanying images offer a detailed exploration of the most frequently occurring words linked to females in the summaries. Correferences have been categorized based on their part of speech, including nouns, adjectives, verbs, and proper nouns. This categorization allows for a more granular understanding of the linguistic elements shaping the portrayal of women in cinematic narratives.

        The noteworthy observation drawn from these reference plots is the prevalence of the term "husband" in the initial three regions, seemingly implying that women should be defined by their marital status. Another significant term is "home," ranking first in Asia and Europe, suggesting the perception of women as an integral part of domestic life. Notably, the term "kitchen" is discernible in Europe, reinforcing the persistent stereotype about women. <br>
        Delving into Joléa's values, we discern words like "leader" in Asia or "fighter" in India, aligning with the strong character of our actress.

        Examining adjectival references reveals predominantly age-related, class-related, and emotion-related descriptors used to characterize women.
        Particularly, young women appear dominant in Asia and India, whereas middle-aged women take precedence in Europe and Northern America. <br>
        Women seem to be portrayed as strong and independent in Asia, as indicated by terms such as "successful," "battlefield," "anti-communist," and "criminal," portraying them not just as homemakers but as individuals fighting for their values. Joléa would appreciate this apparent strength. <br>
        Conversely, prevalent adjectives in Europe concerning women include "dead," "sick," "pet," "servitude," and even "suspicious." The same holds for Northern America with terms like "dead," "unobserved," "fanatical," "pregnant," and "useless."
        What actress would want to represent an industry casting women in such a degrading light? Certainly not Joléa.

        Once again, Asia positions women in significant values-driven roles, with words like "participate," "escape," "happens," "want," and "hide-and-seek," portraying women as masters of their own destiny. <br>
        In contrast, India seems to depict women primarily as "housemaids" and "governesses," roles that do not align with Joléa's interests.

        Analyzing proper nouns related to females in summaries is intriguing as it allows us to determine if women are consistently linked to male characters. Across all regions, the prominent nouns include "father," "son," "ex-wife," "brother," and even "lover," all of which establish connections between women and men.

    <h2> Recommendation for Joléa's career </h2>
    <p>
        Long-term wise, two regions appear equally interesting for an ambitious woman that aims to settle where she coud live a fulfilling career. Europe and Northern America would be welcoming on this aspect, even though work should still be pursued to reach equal opportunities.
        <br><br>
        In essence, the summaries analysis reveals nuanced portrayals of women across regions. While Asia presents strong, independent figures aligning with Joléa's values, Europe and Northern America tend to lean towards more stereotypical and negative depictions. The consistent link of women to male figures underscores a pervasive theme. We would thus recommend Joléa to go for Asia industry to have the best female representation.
        <br><br>
        We hope that Joléa will ADApt to her environnment and be part of a new generation that will bring a new normality and undo the differences between the genders !

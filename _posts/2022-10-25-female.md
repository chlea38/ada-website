title: Female representation
---

Gender is an essential part of a person's identity. Actresses and actors play role models or anti-heroes, and the public will project itself in the representation made in films, influenced by what they see. To support Joléa blooming career and prepare her the best we can, we investigate to determine if she should brace herself to be treated differently than her male counterparts.
We would like to answer some of the following questions : are acting professionals treated equally in term of opportunities, profiles sought by the industry, character storylines and descriptions, independently of prism of gender, and does it vary depending on the geographical region ? Let's discover it below: we will investigate to quantify differences (in numbers of film, in percentage in films) and if time saw evolutions, then determine if profiles sought (via the variable age, via vocabulary used) vary depending on gender.

## Gender differences ?

With over 130 000 entries, the dataset ratio of 40% female and 60% male actors is not as unbalanced as one could have expected. We find a common However, we are now seasoned ADAist and know that we will need to set our expectations aside and let the data speak.

To begin with, we mentionned the global ratio of female and male actors just above, but we explored its evolution in regard to time.

After some trials (percentage by film, then by year or by decade) we settled to plot the actresses percentage by year, using a rolling window method to smooth inherent variations due to the finite number of entries. Even with this correction, we can hardly interpret data from before 1950, as there is very high variation that could not be corresponding to the reality. However, it does not bother us for our analysis, as cinema started its impressive growth to become asstime around the fifties, and it is past this point that we can gather.

## Acting age, a telling information

The age variable is one of high interest, and difference in treatment of the status of a person depending on their age may vary through the cultures. While in Europe, a man in his fifties could be described "mature" when a woman of the same age could be qualified "wilted", we do not know in Asia or India if the adjectives are not inverted !

We obtain similar observations independently of the geographical region: actresses and actors do not have the same career path age-wise and are differently sought by the industry. During teenage years and until below their thirties actresses are as present as actors, but at the mark of 30-40 years old, we visualize a change. The "peak" of acting happens between 25 and 30 years old for women, while men reach it in their mid thirties and forties. Actors have a longer carrer and older men (over 60 years old) are still quite well represented, while actresses are rarefying, at varying speed: it is most impressive for the India data, with a strong drop after 25 years old, also distincly visible on the corresponding barplot.

    We hope that Joléa will be part of a new generation that will bring a new normality and undo those differences between the genders !

title: Female representation
---

Gender is an essential part of a person's identity. Actresses and actors play role models or anti-heroes, and the public will project itself in the representation made in films, influenced by what they see. To support Joléa blooming career and to prepare her for the possible differences in treatment, let's prepare as much as possible and investigate.
Thus, we work to answer some of the following questions : are acting professionals treated equally in term of opportunities, profiles sought by the industry, character storylines, independently of prism of gender, and does it vary depending on the geographical region ? Let's discover it below: we will investigate to quantify differences (in numbers of film, in percentage in films) and if time saw evolutions, then determine if profiles sought (via the variable age, via vocabulary used) vary depending on gender.

### Gender differences ?

With over 130 000 entries, the dataset ratio of 40% female and 60% male actors is not as unbalanced as one could have expected. However, we are now seasoned ADAist and know that we will need to set our expectations aside and let the data speak.

To begin with, we mentionned the global ratio of female and male actors just above, but we explored its evolution in regard to time. After some trials (percentage by film, then by year or by decade) we settled to plot the actresses percentage by year, using a rolling window method to smooth inherent variations due to the finite number of entries.

### Acting age, a telling information

The age variable is one of high interest, and difference in treatment of the status of a person depending on their age may vary through the cultures. While in Europe, a man in his fifties could be described "mature" when a woman of the same age could be qualified "wilted", we do not know in Asia or India if the adjectives are not inverted !

All countries present a similar profile, if we base ourselves on the histoplots : during teenage years and until their thirties actresses are as present as actors, but past 35-40 years old, we notice a change. The "peak" of acting happens between 25 and 30 years old for women, while men reach it in their mid thirties and forties. Actors have a longer carrer and older men (over 60 years old) are still quite well represented, while actresses are rarefying, at varying speed: it is most impressive for the India data, with a sharp drop after 25 years old.

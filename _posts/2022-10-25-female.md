title: Female representation
---

Gender is an essential part of a person's identity. Actresses and actors play role models or anti-heroes, endoss various masks and reflet an analysis of the world estate. When watching a movie, the public project itself in the representation made there, influenced by the story they are told, the characters they like or hate, and by the choices made. However, we will unveil some findings that underlines that treatment of character, of representation, is different upon gender. We would like to answer some of the following questions : are acting professionals treated equally in term of opportunities, profiles sought by the industry, character storylines and descriptions, independently of prism of gender, and does it vary depending on the geographical region ? To support Joléa blooming career and prepare her the best we can, we investigate to quantify differences (in numbers of film, in percentage in films) and if time saw evolutions, then determine if profiles sought (via the variable age, via vocabulary used) vary depending on gender.

## Gender representation

With over 130 000 entries, the dataset ratio of 40% female and 60% male actors is not as unbalanced as one could have expected. However, we are now seasoned ADAist and know that we will need to set our expectations aside and let the data speak.

Overlooking the timeline (our dataset spans over more than 100 years), in each region female actors represent less than 40 percent of the gendered entries of our dataset. It represents roughly 2000 actresses and ~3300 actors in India, while at the opposite of the spectrum, Northen America is represented with ~30 000 actresses and ~ 50 000 actors. In all cases, men are thus more represented on-screen.

## Acting age, a telling information

The age variable is one of high interest, and difference in treatment of the status of a person depending on their age may vary through the cultures. While in Europe, a man in his fifties could be described "mature" when a woman of the same age could be qualified "wilted", we do not know in Asia or India if the adjectives are not inverted ! The sentiment analysis, two plots below, aims to explore these possibilitíes.

We obtain similar observations independently of the geographical region: actresses and actors do not have the same career path age-wise and are differently sought by the industry. During teenage years and until below their thirties actresses are as present as actors, but at the mark of 30-40 years old, we visualize a change. The "peak" of acting happens between 25 and 30 years old for women, while men reach it in their mid thirties and forties. Actors have a longer carrer and older men (over 60 years old) are still quite well represented, while actresses are rarefying, at varying speed: it is most impressive for the India data, with a strong drop after 25 years old, also distincly visible on the corresponding barplot.

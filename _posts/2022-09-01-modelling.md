Jol√©a is among many "aspiring actors" wondering which is the most suitable region for their careers. This is why she asked ADAventurer to generate a prediction model. The goal of this model would be to predict which region is best fitted for a given actor based on:
- The desired income
- The prefered movie genre
- Ethnicity
- Gender

  ### Data pre-processing

  ### A performant model

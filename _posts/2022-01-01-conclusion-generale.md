This project, blending data analytics, machine learning, and insights into the film industry, has provided essential guidance for an aspiring actress like Joléa. It highlights the critical role of networking in the film industry, showing how connections with influential figures, or 'big whales', can significantly impact an actor's career.

The study also shed light on the dynamics of gender and ethnicity within the industry. It revealed persistent gender disparities, with women facing different challenges and standards than their male counterparts, particularly in terms of career longevity and descriptive language. Additionally, the project emphasized the importance of ethnic diversity in films, underlining the need for more inclusive representation that mirrors societal shifts.

An in-depth analysis of movie plot summaries revealed that the portrayal of women varies across different regional cinema industries. 

The machine learning model provided insights into which regions might be most suitable for actors, considering factors such as potential income, movie genre preferences, ethnicity, and gender. This information is crucial in helping Joléa make strategic career decisions.

Overall, the project underscores the importance of building strong industry networks, understanding the influence of gender and ethnicity in film, and choosing roles and regions that align with personal and artistic goals. For anyone aspiring to succeed in the dynamic and competitive field of cinema, staying adaptable and informed about industry trends is essential.

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations associated with our dataset. The dataset is unbalanced, with numerous missing values, potentially introducing bias in our findings. Additionally, our dataset is incomplete, spanning only until 2013, and exhibits a significant underrepresentation of South American and African movies. It's essential to interpret our conclusions with this in mind and consider the need for a more diverse and up-to-date dataset for a comprehensive understanding of the global cinematic landscape.

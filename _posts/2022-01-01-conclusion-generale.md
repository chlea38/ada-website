    The study shed light on the dynamics of gender and ethnicity within the industry. It revealed persistent gender disparities, with women facing different challenges and standards than their male counterparts, particularly in terms of career longevity and descriptive language. An in-depth analysis of movie plot summaries revealed that the portrayal of women varies across different regional cinematic industries. The project also emphasized the importance of ethnic diversity in films, underlining the need for more inclusive representation that mirrors societal shifts. Additionally, tje project highlights the critical role of networking in the film industry, showing how connections with influential figures, or 'big whales', can significantly impact an actor's career.

    The machine learning model provided insights into which regions might be most suitable for actors, considering factors such as potential income, movie genre preferences, ethnicity, and gender. This information is crucial in helping Joléa make strategic career decisions.

     In the light of Joléa's aspiration to become a shining star, our analysis reveals that each industry has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Depending on what holds greater significance for our actress, she should carefully weigh the options and choose the most suitable area to pursue her dreams of becoming the star she has always aspired to be, following our specific recommendations.

    However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations associated with our dataset. The dataset is unbalanced, with numerous missing values, potentially introducing bias in our findings. Additionally, our dataset is incomplete, spanning only until 2013, and exhibits a significant underrepresentation of South American and African movies. It's essential to interpret our conclusions with this in mind and consider the need for a more diverse and up-to-date dataset for a comprehensive understanding of the global cinematic landscape.
